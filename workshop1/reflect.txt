ï»¿This workshop reinforced my understanding of linkage, static variables, and dynamic memory allocation in C++. Internal linkage, exemplified by static int counter, confines symbols to a single translation unit. External linkage, showcased by g_taxrate and g_dailydiscount, allows visibility across translation units. Static variables, like counter, retain their values across function calls, aiding in cumulative operations. Upgrading the FoodOrder class involved transitioning from a fixed-size character array to a dynamically allocated char* for flexible description storage. Proper memory management was crucial, necessitating memory allocation in the constructor, deallocation in the destructor, and dynamic reallocation in the read function to prevent memory leaks. This workshop consolidated my grasp on fundamental C++ concepts, enhancing my ability to design efficient and robust code

In this project, I developed a production line simulation by implementing the Workstation, Station, and LineManager classes. I managed customer orders, set up state transitions, and ensured smooth component integration.

Key Learnings:
System Design: Improved skills in designing and integrating complex systems.
State Management: Gained experience in handling and transitioning order states.
Robustness: Enhanced understanding of error handling and validation.
This project provided valuable insights into class design and system integration.
